#GistCommentEmailer

###Rails-based webapp to email you (with frequency/trigger tbd) whenever someone comments on a gist of your's. 

Fills in crazy lack of basic message notification functionality for GitHub's gists. Once they fix that, you won't need this silly thing!


Email notifications work with regular old repos, for commits and pulls.  It seems strange that this functionality has not been implemented. While some people make little use of gists, other use them extensively. However, without the most basic community feature of a notification, they're little more than a dumping ground for text. Let's change that.

###Use the service
GistCommentEmailer is hosted on heroku, and can be found at http://gistcommentemailer.herokuapp.com

###Contribute
I wrote this because there are people I know that could use it. Help me make it better, and don't forget to tell Github you want them to add this functionality natively.
