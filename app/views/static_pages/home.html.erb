  <h1>Get emails of gist comments!</h1>
  <p class="lead">We all wish Github emailed us when someone comments on a gist we own. Sadly they don't seem to be implementing that functionality, so until they do, you can find it right here.</p>

    <h4>Tell Github you want this!</h4>
    <p>This site is a sub-optimal hack meant to get us what we need. It'd be much better if Github had this feature natively, so ask.</p>

    <h4>Tweet at them</h4>
    <p><a target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@github%20&related=github&url=https://github.com/blog/624-gist-comments">@github</a></p>

    <h4>Email them</h4>

    <h4>In the meantime...</h4>
    <p>Use this service to get good-enough functionality.</p>

    <h4>Sign in with Github</h4>
    <p>Using OAuth, sign in so I can track who wants to be notified (don't worry, you'll be able to opt out</p>

    <h4>Receive a daily digest</h4>
    <p>This will begin as a daily digest of new comments on your gists. I'm open to feedback on increasing that rate</p>
